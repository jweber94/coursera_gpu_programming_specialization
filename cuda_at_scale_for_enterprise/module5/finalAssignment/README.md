# Final Assignment Code

## NPP Library introduction

## Other students examples
+ Here are some examples of other students that can be used as a reference for the scope of work to pass the assignment:
    - https://github.com/TannerFirl/CUDAatScaleForTheEnterpriseCourseProject --> This is a reasonable amount of work in my opinion
    - https://github.com/rybakov/CudaRescale --> This is a very bad example
    - https://github.com/JulienFleuret/CUDA-At-Scale-For-Enterprise-Final-Project-V1 --> This is an overkill example
