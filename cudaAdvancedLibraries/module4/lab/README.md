# Lab of the Thrust Library module

## Important remarks
* To make the radix sort example build, you need to copy the `helper_string.h`from the cuda samples (https://librapid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/program_listing_file_librapid_include_librapid_cuda_helper_string.h.html) - the file does exist but it is empty
* Like it is mentioned in the video, you need to adjust the makefile a little due to permission issues on the coursera machines
